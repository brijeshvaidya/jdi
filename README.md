# JDI

Have spare time and so many tasks to get done, but don't know where to start? Just grab your mobile, tablet or laptop and start a **JDI session**! Available on Android and iOS, JDI is a fully functionnal To Do app which offers a new way to prioritize tasks. The user simply selects the available time and the app picks the tasks that should be done right now. JDI give you the force to get your tasks done, *just do it* now!


## Demo

JDI was originally developed as part of the ["HTML5 is Ready App Contest"](http://www.sencha.com/html5-is-ready) and won the **first** prize. Currently, JDI is **NOT** actively maintained and is meant only to demonstrate the use of the Sencha Touch and Sencha.io frameworks.
